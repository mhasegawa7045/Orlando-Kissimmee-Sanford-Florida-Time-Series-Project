# Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford-Florida-Time-Series-Project
Still in Progress

The project will forecast the March non-seasonally adjusted estimate for Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL; the forecast will use weekly earnings and the total employment as the focused variables and the rest as predictors. This project is meant to do one-step ahead for any metropolitan area in Florida. The methods used to do this project are exploratory data analysis, AC, PAC, regress, best model selection from GSREG and rolling window technique, and forecasting.
